    <h5>A HackClub Project</h5>
    
</div>

## Why?
I think it's a fun project that may just see some actual use for someone.
With this project I'm also actively learning how to use the netty library.
And of course we all learn more about our favourite block game with this!

## What is done?
- [x] Spawning in
- [x] Server-side handling of player movement
- [x] Basic chat feature
- [x] Message of the day (SLP / Server List Ping)
- [x] Keep Alive so the client doesn't disconnect (No server-side timeout yet)
- [ ] Sending chunk data (Bugged, needs to be fixed)
- [ ] Probably some refactoring (PRs welcome)
- [ ] Inventory handling
- [ ] World saving/loading (maybe)
- More to come...
