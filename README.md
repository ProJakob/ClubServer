    <h5>A HackClub Project</h5>
    
</div>

## Why?
I think it's a fun project that may just see some actual use for someone.
With this project I'm also actively learning how to use the netty library.
And of course we all learn more about our favourite block game with this!

### Why the name?
Simple: The Club comes from HackClub and the Server, well because it's a Server!

## What is done?
- [x] Spawning in
- [x] Server-side handling of player movement
- [x] Basic chat feature
- [x] Message of the day (SLP / Server List Ping)
- [x] Keep Alive so the client doesn't disconnect (No server-side timeout yet)
- [ ] Sending chunk data (Bugged, needs to be fixed)
- [ ] Probably some refactoring (PRs welcome)
- [ ] Inventory handling
- [ ] World saving/loading (maybe)
- [ ] World interaction
- [ ] Entities and other players (Forever alone :<)
- [ ] Plugin API maybe??
- More to come...

## The Goal?
Thats right, I have a set goal that I really want to get to: get this project so far that I can build a minigame with it, TNTRun or even BedWars if I get enough time.

## Sources
I source my information from [wiki.vg](https://wiki.vg/index.php?title=Protocol&oldid=7368) and a decompiled Minecraft Client & Server Workspace that has been generated using [MCP](https://www.modcoderpack.com/) and [ForgeGradle](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/ForgeGradle)

## My statistics on Hackatime
Don't ask me why there are two Java entries, I don't know either.
